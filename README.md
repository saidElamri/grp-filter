## Usage

### Running the Application

1. Open terminal/command prompt in the project directory
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```

3. Open your web browser and go to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```
   or
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

### Using the Application

1. **View Students**: All current students are displayed at the top of the page

2. **Add a Student**:
   - Type the student's name in the input box
   - Click "Add Student"
   - The student will be added to the roster

3. **Remove a Student**:
   - Click the red **‚úï** button next to any student's name
   - Confirm the removal in the popup dialog

4. **Generate Groups**:
   - Click "Generate Random Groups of 4 with Seating"
   - The app will create random groups of 4 students
   - Each group gets assigned a random seating location
   - Any remaining students (not divisible by 4) will be shown separately

5. **Regenerate Groups**:
   - Click the generate button again to create new random combinations

### Stopping the Application
- Go back to the terminal
- Press `Ctrl + C`

## Seating Locations

The application includes these seating areas:
- Front Left, Front Center, Front Right
- Middle Left, Middle Center, Middle Right
- Back Left, Back Center, Back Right
- Window Side, Door Side, Lab Area

You can customize these locations by editing the `SEATING_AREAS` list in `app.py`.

## Customization

### Adding/Changing Initial Students
Edit the `STUDENTS` list in `app.py`:
```python
STUDENTS = [
    "Manal", "Moubarak", "Lahcen", "Chami", "Assma", "Fatima",
    # Add or remove names here
]
```

### Customizing Seating Areas
Edit the `SEATING_AREAS` list in `app.py`:
```python
SEATING_AREAS = [
    "Your Custom Location 1",
    "Your Custom Location 2",
    # Add your classroom locations here
]
```

### Changing Group Size
To change from groups of 4 to another size, modify this line in the `generate()` function:
```python
num_groups = len(shuffled) // 4  # Change 4 to your desired group size
```

## Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Student data is stored in memory only. When you restart the application, any students added or removed during the session will be reset to the original list defined in the code.

If you need persistent storage (saving students permanently), consider adding a database or file storage system.

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'`
- **Solution**: Install Flask using `pip install flask` or `pip3 install flask`

**Problem**: Port already in use
- **Solution**: Stop other applications using port 5000, or change the port in the last line of `app.py`:
  ```python
  app.run(debug=True, port=5001)  # Use a different port
  ```

**Problem**: "Not Found" error when clicking buttons
- **Solution**: Make sure you're using the latest version of the code with `url_for()` functions
