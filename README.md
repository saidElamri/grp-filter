## Seating Locations

The application includes these seating areas:
- Front Left, Front Center, Front Right
- Middle Left, Middle Center, Middle Right
- Back Left, Back Center, Back Right
- Window Side, Door Side, Lab Area

You can customize these locations by editing the `SEATING_AREAS` list in `app.py`.

## Customization

### Adding/Changing Initial Students
Edit the `STUDENTS` list in `app.py`:
```python
STUDENTS = [
    "Manal", "Moubarak", "Lahcen", "Chami", "Assma", "Fatima",
    # Add or remove names here
]
```

### Customizing Seating Areas
Edit the `SEATING_AREAS` list in `app.py`:
```python
SEATING_AREAS = [
    "Your Custom Location 1",
    "Your Custom Location 2",
    # Add your classroom locations here
]
```

### Changing Group Size
To change from groups of 4 to another size, modify this line in the `generate()` function:
```python
num_groups = len(shuffled) // 4  # Change 4 to your desired group size
```

## Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Student data is stored in memory only. When you restart the application, any students added or removed during the session will be reset to the original list defined in the code.

If you need persistent storage (saving students permanently), consider adding a database or file storage system.
